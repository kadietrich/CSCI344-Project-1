        <h4>Do I have to pay to use Music Monitor?</h4>
        <p>You do not have to pay. However, if you'd like to support us then feel free to donate to us in the form hugs, 
          freshly baked goods, or words of encouragement.</p>
        <h4>What's with the lizard for a logo?</h4>
        <p>There is a reptile known as a monitor lizard. Since "monitor" is part of our name we thought it was a decent
          enough fit for a logo idea. Unfortunately, our mascot does not yet have a name, but we are working on that.</p>
        <h4>Can Music Monitor be used to download music?</h4>
        <p>Music Monitor is not a download service so it is not capable of downloading music files. We do not plan to implement
          such a function either. However, it is possible that some of its tracking results may point to places that allow 
          you to download music.</p>
